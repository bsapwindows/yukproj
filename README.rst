Yuk
====

**Yuk** is a web bookmark service (think `Pinboard`_) built on top of Django, 
using Postgres. It remains a self-learning exercise as I continue to refine and
expand its features and functionality.

Currently, it supports storing three types of information: 
1. Bookmarks
2. Notes
3. Quotes

**Yuk** also supports importing and exporting bookmarks in the `del.icio.us`_
HTL format. You can also import bookmarks via RSS feeds. I also have a book-
marklet implemented in the base.html template.

Fundamentally this is a platform for me to try new things in web development,
but just by coincidence it also happens to be a minimal, but functional,
web bookmarking service that I use every day. You can see my profile page

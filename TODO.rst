To-Do List
============

**In descending order by priority:**

1. *Implement private & public flags for all objects (RSS feeds, individual
   links, notes, etc.)* **3/5/11:** Done

2. Implement `pinboard`_-like "Notes". (Maybe add a "Google this later" checkbox
   that will auto-generate a search URL and save as a URL with "search" tag.
   Create bookmarklet to access search items...)

3. Implement "Quotes" - Model: two CharFields (quote, who said it), one URLField
   (link to source/twitter profile of source/etc.)

4. User registration & authentication via Twitter

5. User registration & auth via Facebook

6. User registration & auth via other OAuth/OpenID sources

7. Improve landing page for new/unauthenticated users with better explanation of
   the service up front.
